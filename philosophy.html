      <h1>"In order to motivate yourself further, you must discover things yourself. The art of a good teacher is knowing when to feed in and when to pull back."</h1>
      <p>This is a documentary featuring Bill and Harry Evans, two jazz pianists and brothers. My love of Jazz had led me to study some of the musical theory and within it I found one of the most powerful influences to me as an educator.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Harry Evans was a jazz teacher and he discusses teaching music with his brother Bill. Although the concepts are grounded in musical theory, I found them true at the core of teaching as an artform.</p>

      <h1>"You must try to teach principles which are separate from style. You must extract the principles of music which have nothing to do with style"</h1>
      <p>One of the most challenging aspects of a teacher, is to understand where the core principles lie within the materials we teach. We know there are core concepts, skills, and principles that exist within all meaningful and creative work. Understanding what they and how they are used is the goal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="philosophy-quote">
      <h1>"The essence of teaching is to get the student excited about the subject and explore it on their own"</h1>
      <p>One of my teacher mentors once said, "everything is about marketing". Within teaching, our passion spills out to the students. How we get them excited about their work is the first step in managing an effective learning environment. Whether we do so in how we package the learning content, or plan out our lessons, or hold the passion within ourselves and let it flow outwards, is how we instill motivation within our students learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="philosophy-quote">
      <h1>"Jazz is not so much a style, as much as it is a process of making music. Jazz is a certain process of spontaneity."</h1>
      <p>Improvisation is at the heart of Jazz. All jazz strives to understand the theory enough to be able to express yourself freely with it and make it your own. In the same way, play in education is vital as it is through play, that students improvise the knowledge they've attained. It not only improves their understanding, but allows them to create something on their own.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="philosophy-quote">
      <h1>"It is better to do something simple that is real. It can still be satisfactory, but it is something you can build on because you know what you are doing."</h1>
      <p>This was in reference to "overplaying" in Jazz. I feel students also can "overplay" in terms of the work they produce. They may try to make it more fancy and decorative at the cost of not fully understanding what they are doing. All to impress a teacher. Emphasizing understanding should be held as the more important.</p>
