      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>This is an ongoing project that my students are currently working on. The project asks students and introspective question of what a "home" means to them. What is in a home? What characteristics define a home? What are the requirements of a home? We then learn about isometric design and how to implement shape and form into their work. They then will answer the original project prompt by creating an isometric home that represents what a "home" means to them metaphorically and symbolically throughout their design.</p>
      <p>The project is part of a series of projects used to learn how to use the Adobe creative software. This project in particular uses Adobe Illustrator.<em> Project is in progress and student work will be shown once they finish!</em></p>
