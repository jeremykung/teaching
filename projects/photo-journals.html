      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Each week, students post 2 photographic journal entries on their websites. The goal is to take photographs each week, and write a short journal entry about anything they would like to share. They also comment and reply to one other posts each week to offer suggestions, share their thoughts, and or simply leave a nice note about the image our journal entry. The journal topic is completely open for the students to explore, as is the subject of their photography. Some students have posted about battles with depression, thoughts they've kept inside with no way to express them before, thoughts about life, shared moments of friends and or family, all the good and all the bad.</p>
      <p>Overall, the project has been exceptionally positive for students and for myself as their teacher. It not only allows the students to express themselves freely through photography, and see the progression of their work over time, but also gives me a better glimpse of my students from a side that I don't often see in the classroom. <em>All photos below are taken by this year's photography class.</em></p>
