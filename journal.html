    <h1>Journal</h1>
    <p>This is a section of reflection and thoughts. I often find inspiration for teaching in moments that are not related to the teaching practice. This is a place for me to share what I find interesting and how they get me thinking about my own practice.</p>

      <h1>Jung on failure</h1>
      <p class="quote">“Mistakes are, after all, the foundations of truth, and if a man does not know what a thing is, it is at least an increase in knowledge if he knows what it is not. ”
        ― Carl G. Jung</p>
      <p>I've been interested in Jung a lot these days and this is one of his quotes that resonated with me as an educator. We often talk about failure as a good thing in Education, to the point where I feel it is almost a cliché. This quote however got me to think deeper about how we incorporate the idea of failure in teaching. Perhaps it is not enough to simply normalize failure, but to intentionally plan for failure. The quote understand failure as the foundations of truth. As a teacher, can I purposefully set up students to fail in order to realize a truth? Can I not encourage students to fail, but actually plan for them to fail?</p>
